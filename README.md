# Welcome to Beity!

This file will act as an introduction to the application. It includes a setup tutorial, as well as some standards that all developers must use.

## Installation

We use Next.js as our frontend framework to handle all the user experience. You can find the documentation [here.](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) 

To download the framework, all you need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Once you have these installed, you can use the `npx create-next-app@latest` to create a new Next project. Play around with it for a bit to get the feel of the framework.
